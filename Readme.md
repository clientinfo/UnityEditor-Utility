# Unity Editor Utility

**Unity Editor Utility** is a powerful plugin designed to enhance your Unity Editor experience by addressing common annoyances and improving workflow efficiency. 
This project specifically targets issues related to the animation controller, making it easier to manage layers and set default properties.

## Features

- **Fixes Animation Controller Layer List Jumping**: Prevents the layer list from jumping back to the top after adding a new layer to a animator controller, allowing for easier renaming and management of new layers.
- **Fixes Parameter List Jumping**: Prevents the Parameterlist from jumping back to the top after adding a new Parameter to the animator controller, allowing for easier renaming and management of new Parameters.
- **Set Default Weight**: Automatically sets the default weight of new layers in the animation controller to 1.0.

## Note
None of the Features can be turned of so be carefull, i may add a toggle for this in the future.

## Credits
Special thanks to my friend Ecstasy for the original hooking class used in this project.
